# Word-Guess-Game

Link: https://kobbootcamp.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/

The challenge was to create a word guess game in the style of hangman.
I used a football theme.  The user starts the game by clicking the "Kick off" button.
It's first down!  A randlomly selected masked word (shown as *) is displayed.  The user guesses letters by selecting them from the keyboard.
Correctly guessed letters are revealed in the display, and a 1st down is awarded.
Incorrectly guessed words will cost you a down.  
Previously guess words are displayed at the bottom of the screen.
Guess the word before you run out of downs to win.
If you run out of downs, you committed a turnover!  Game over.
Click the Enter key or "Kick Off" to play again.

This game uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
